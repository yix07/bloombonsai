# BloomBons.ai

bloom bonsai is a **React Native app** that helps users with ADHD break down large, overwhelming financial goals into manageable subtasks using generative AI. Tasks are structured as a **4-ary tree** (up to 3 levels deep) and visualized as a growing 3D bonsai tree in **Three.js**.

## Features

### ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Financial Planning
- AI generates **subtasks** to break down large financial goals (e.g., financing a car, planning a wedding, signing up for a credit card).
- Completing tasks **grows a 3D tree** model, providing visual motivation.
- Track **incomplete and high-priority financial tasks**.
- Progress indicators for each financial goal and tree.

### ðŸŽ¨ 3D Visualization
- **Three.js** dynamically renders bonsai trees.
- **Hunyuan3D 2.0** generates bonsai visuals.
- A **visual grid of trees** represents financial goals.
- Users can revisit and interact with completed financial plans.

### ðŸ”— Web3 & Decentralized Storage
- **Base Layer 2** stores **financial goal metadata** on-chain.
- **IPFS** for goal sharing & accountability.
- Potential **Base microtransactions** for financial milestone incentives.
